# Introduction
Hello! My name is Jack Anstey. I am an Emory alum where I majored in Computer Science and Math & Political Science (a joint major). You can read more about my previous work and things about me at my website <a href = "https://jackanstey.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am also a GitHub Campus Expert alum and I'm always willing to help out if you have any questions about integrating GitHub onto your campus.

Below are some of my favorite projects that I have made myself or have had the opportunity to work on throughout the years:
