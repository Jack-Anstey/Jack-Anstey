# Introduction

Hello! I'm Jack Anstey, a full time data scientist and a part time graduate student at University of Washington for Computer Science and Engineering. You can read more about my work and my skills at my [website](https://jackanstey.com).

I am also a GitHub Campus Expert alum and I'm always willing to help out if you have any questions about integrating GitHub onto your campus.
